# Changelog

## 1.10.1 - 2026-05-17

### Highlights

- **Compound engineering** — `/compound` command, `compound-engineering` skill, and `docs/solutions/` for durable capture after Plan → Work → Review (intended after verify / quality gates, not as a substitute for tests). Documented in `skills/sdd-workflow/SKILL.md`, `docs/COMMAND-AGENT-MAP.md`, and `COMMANDS-QUICK-REF.md`. OpenCode: `/compound` is registered in bundled `.opencode/opencode.json` with `.opencode/commands/compound.md`; parity docs list **27** OpenCode commands to match the `command` object.
- **One SDD surface alignment** — renames and config updates from legacy ECC / everything-claude-code style identifiers to One SDD–oriented paths and filenames across plugins, hooks, OpenCode, and team metadata where applicable.
- **Spec Kit SDD lane** — `sdd-speckit` ships `.specify/` plus canonical **`skills/speckit-*`** (Claude Code and Codex via `./skills/`); **`.cursor/skills/speckit-*`** stays mirrored for Cursor (`npm run sync:speckit-cursor`); **OpenCode** loads the same files via `.opencode/opencode.json` `instructions`. Vendored `vendor/spec-kit.lock.json`; `scripts/vendor-spec-kit.js`; root `CONSTITUTION.md`; `docs/SDD-SETUP.md`.
- **Observer / learning skills** — `ONE_SDD_*` environment hooks in continuous-learning flows; `skills/continuous-learning`, `skills/continuous-learning-v2`, and `skills/openclaw-persona-forge` in the catalog.
- **Install validation** — `scripts/ci/validate-install-manifests.js` warns on missing optional paths (pruned checkouts) while preserving schema and profile invariants; CI validator tests capture stderr on success paths.

### Release Surface

- Catalog counts: **15** agents, **58** skills, **25** commands (`manifests/install-modules.json` lists `skills/speckit-*` under `sdd-speckit`; `skills/compound-engineering` under `framework-language`; `install-components.json` adds `baseline:speckit`).
- Selective install and antigravity expectations updated for `sdd-speckit` on core profile; solution-library stub at `docs/solutions/README.md`.

## 1.10.0 - 2026-04-05

### Highlights

- Public release surface synced to the live repo after multiple weeks of OSS growth and backlog merges.
- Operator workflow lane expanded with voice, graph-ranking, billing, workspace, and outbound skills.
- Media generation lane expanded with Manim and Remotion-first launch tooling.
- One SDD 2.0 alpha control-plane binary now builds locally from `ecc2/` and exposes the first usable CLI/TUI surface.

### Release Surface

- Updated plugin, marketplace, Codex, OpenCode, and agent metadata to `1.10.0`.
- Synced published counts to the live OSS surface: 38 agents, 156 skills, 72 commands.
- One-SDD prune: trimmed to 15 agents, 40 skills, 24 commands (general + Java/Python/JS/TS focus); added Spec Driven Development pipeline (`/one-sdd:init|constitution|specify|clarify|design|tasks|implement|verify|status` + `sdd-workflow` skill); mcp-servers cut to 8 general-purpose entries; rules pared to common/java/python/typescript/web/zh.
- Refreshed top-level install-facing docs and marketplace descriptions to match current repo state.

### New Workflow Lanes

- `brand-voice` — canonical source-derived writing-style system.
- `social-graph-ranker` — weighted warm-intro graph ranking primitive.
- `connections-optimizer` — network pruning/addition workflow on top of graph ranking.
- `customer-billing-ops`, `google-workspace-ops`, `project-flow-ops`, `workspace-surface-audit`.
- `manim-video`, `remotion-video-creation`, `nestjs-patterns`.

### One SDD 2.0 Alpha

- `cargo build --manifest-path ecc2/Cargo.toml` passes on the repository baseline.
- `ecc-tui` currently exposes `dashboard`, `start`, `sessions`, `status`, `stop`, `resume`, and `daemon`.
- The alpha is real and usable for local experimentation, but the broader control-plane roadmap remains incomplete and should not be treated as GA.

### Notes

- The Claude plugin remains limited by platform-level rules distribution constraints; the selective install / OSS path is still the most reliable full install.
- This release is a repo-surface correction and ecosystem sync, not a claim that the full One SDD 2.0 roadmap is complete.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-03-20

- Language coverage expanded to 10+ ecosystems with 6 new agents and language-specific rules.

### Highlights

- Harness-first release focused on reliability, eval discipline, and autonomous loop operations.
- Hook runtime now supports profile-based control and targeted hook disabling.
- NanoClaw v2 adds model routing, skill hot-load, branching, search, compaction, export, and metrics.

### Core

- Added new commands: `/harness-audit`, `/loop-start`, `/loop-status`, `/quality-gate`, `/model-route`.
- Added new skills:
  - `agent-harness-construction`
  - `agentic-engineering`
  - `ralphinho-rfc-pipeline`
  - `ai-first-engineering`
  - `enterprise-agent-ops`
  - `nanoclaw-repl`
  - `continuous-agent-loop`
- Added new agents:
  - `harness-optimizer`
  - `loop-operator`

### Hook Reliability

- Fixed SessionStart root resolution with robust fallback search.
- Moved session summary persistence to `Stop` where transcript payload is available.
- Added quality-gate and cost-tracker hooks.
- Replaced fragile inline hook one-liners with dedicated script files.
- Added `ONE_SDD_HOOK_PROFILE` and `ONE_SDD_DISABLED_HOOKS` controls.

### Cross-Platform

- Improved Windows-safe path handling in doc warning logic.
- Hardened observer loop behavior to avoid non-interactive hangs.

### Notes

- `autonomous-loops` is kept as a compatibility alias for one release; `continuous-agent-loop` is the canonical name.
